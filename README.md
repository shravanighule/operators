Aim: To study and implement operators in c++

Theory: Operators in C++ are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on data, enabling tasks like arithmetic, comparisons, and logical evaluations. They are categorized into several types:

-Arithmetic Operators: Used for basic math operations, including +, -, *, /, and %.

-Relational Operators: Used for comparisons, such as ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=.

-Logical Operators: Allow combining conditions, using &&, ||, and !.

-Bitwise Operators: Perform operations on bits, including &, |, ^, ~, <<, and >>.

-Assignment Operators: Assign values and can perform operations like =, +=, -=, *=, and /=.

-Increment/Decrement Operators: Increase or decrease a variable's value by one (++ and --).
